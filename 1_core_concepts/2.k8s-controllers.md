K8s Controllers 
- They are the processes that monitor k8s objects (Pods, SVC) and respond accordingly. One of those controller is Replication Controller.

Replication Controller:
- It ensures the numbers of desired/manifested pods is equal to the number of running pods.
- It ensures the scalability if demand increases for Pods, by increasing pods.

Labels and Selectors
- Labels are set during creation of k8s object which act as identifiers
- Selectors are written in other k8s objects like Services, to select objects like Pods based on labels.
